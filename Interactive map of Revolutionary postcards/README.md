# Interactive map of Revolutionary postcards
Most of the existing research on postcards is focused on their visual presentation. Tourism studies and historical studies cover a wide range of subjects in which postcards, especially images of postcards are used to explore perceptions of places, cultures, and certain groups of people.
However, postcards contain more information than just images and texts.
261 postcards, mostly sent during the 1917 Revolution in Russia, were found and provided in digital form by Maria Tychilina, an employee of the Mayakovsky Library. Maria is engaged in genealogical research. For genealogical research, postcards, organized and presented on an interactive map with a timeline, are a source of genealogical information.
When we present postcards sent in the context of certain historical periods and global events, we need to focus on specific dates that can be compared with data on the dates of historical events. An equally important factor is the understanding and visual interpretation of the geographical locations of the place of sending and receiving postcards, the name and status of the sender and addressee, as well as the address of the place where the postcard was subsequently found. This allows for the spatial data analysis and to obtain new conclusions, visions and cultural data.
Therefore, it was necessary to implement the Digital Humanities project in the format of a web resource, which systematized and geo-visualized postcards sent during the revolution.
## Goals and objectives of the project
The research goals of the Digital Humanities project are systematization of postcards to search for ancestors and displaying postcards on a map with a timeline for interpreting postcards as a source of cultural and historical information. The project promotes educational, cultural and tourism activities related to the events of the February and October revolutions of 1917-1918 that took place in Petrograd.
The project tasks:
•	search for the most convenient, effective and relevant technological solutions for geovisualization of digital objects of cultural and historical heritage; 
•	systematization of postcards, formation of a database of postcards;
•	creation of a digital interactive exhibition that can be used by historians, culturologists, art historians, students and employees of international scientific laboratories of digital humanities research, people interested in history, genealogy researchers and others;
•	georeferencing of the map of Petrograd and the database of postcards to the actual map of St. Petersburg;
•	creating a timeline on the map to filter postcards by year;
•	application of the methodology for analyzing spatially distributed data - converting coordinates from a geographical reference system into various metric systems;
•	publication of a web resource on the Internet.
